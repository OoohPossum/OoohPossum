## Welcome, reader of this readme about myself!

I'm the "Oooh!"-Possum, most call me just Opossum. Quite new on GitHub.
Middle-aged male, sportive, lots of real-life hobbies, love for tea (and strong coffee/espresso), loving to cook international dishes.

Engineer, entrepreneur, inventor, researcher.
Interested in many fields, quite experienced in some, but not all. :-)

I'm not specifically a coder, tho. Mostly related to the physical hardware-side of creation and development.

If you have specific questions or suggestions, send me a message.

Currently autodidactically gathering experiences at many physical construction works-related aspects, as they are needed for some projects and buildings.
